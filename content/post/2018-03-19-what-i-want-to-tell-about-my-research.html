<p>About primates, what do I want to tell the others?</p>
<p>It is about biodiversity, evolution, and human beings.</p>
<p>To me, the gibbon is only one of the five hundreds of primate species, and the primates are only five hundreds of the ten millions animal species.</p>
<p>In Yunnan, most primates dwelled on forests. So all the stories can not happen without refering to forests. In case of we seeing a monkey or gibbon move in tree canopy, we want to know where they are going and what they are going to do.</p>
<p>But the answers to these questions are difficult to get, we have to use some techniques and pay much efforts. From the simplest way to the most difficult way.</p>
<p>At the begining, I was thinking if I can catch one, and ask him questions.</p>
<p>this revealed their adaptation to forest living.</p>
