<p>About primates, what do I want to tell the others?</p>
<p>It is about biodiversity, evolution, and human beings.</p>
<p>To me, the gibbon is only one of the five hundreds of primate species, and the primates are only five hundreds of the ten millions of animal species.</p>
<p>In Yunnan, most primates dwelled on forests. So all the stories can not happen without refering to forests. In case of we seeing a monkey or gibbon move in tree canopy, we want to know where they are going and what they are going to do.</p>
<p>But the answers to these questions are difficult to get, we have to use some techniques and pay much efforts. From the simplest to the most difficult.</p>
<p>At the begining, I was thinking if I can catch one, and ask him the questions. Of course it is not true, even I catch one, the monkey does not speak.</p>
<p>What I have to do is doing research in scientific way, and resolve the questions.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” To answer this question, I have to follow the gibbon group for all days. Then I find out, they are heading to valley to forage ripe fruits; they are going to mountain ridge to bathe in the sun；they are going to patrol the habitat.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” To answer the question, I have to observe them. Then I find out, they are foraging specific nutrient, such as protein; they sing every day for inter-group communication; they choose a proper and flat canopy for playing, which are important activity during their development stage.</p>
<p>For year and year, the answers reveal their adaptation to forest living.</p>
<p>Why they exist, like all the lives, for inheritance of gene, mutation and their culture.</p>
