Anyway, I still do some student work, including secretary working for opening report defencing. So I use grViz to make a step graph for the procedure. 


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("
digraph boxes_and_circles {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica, color=OrangeRed]
  a [label = 'Defence Secretary'];
  b [label = 'Defence Chairman'];
  c [label = 'Teaching Secretary']; 
  d [label = 'All the students']; 
  e [label = 'All the teachers'] 

  # several 'edge' statements
  a -> b [label = 'determine the name list of student', arrowhead = diamond]
  a -> c [label = 'determine the date and classroom', arrowhead = diamond]
  c -> e [arrowhead = diamond]
  d -> e [arrowhead = diamond]
  a -> d [label = 'collect all the opening reports', arrowhead = diamond]
  a -> e [label = 'opening report defence with students', arrowhead = diamond]
}
")

```

Looks awful! 

Still help!
