This is opening ceremony with the first speech. I gave the speech on the topic "The apes and monkeys in Yunnan". In this speech, I talk about primates on the earth. Specifically, I talk leave monkeys and gibbons in Yunnan. All the junior school students showed their passion and curiosity on my topic. Start with the figure "King of monkey", end with how we conduct research on them, and why they need conservation.
