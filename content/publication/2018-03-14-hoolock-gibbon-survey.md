abstract = "The survey reported the hoolock gibbon population status and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the species in Yingjiang County, West Yunnan, China. The survey was undertaken from January to December 2015, Dr. Guan Zhenhua and Associate Professor Li Maobiao from Yunnan Academy of Biodiversity, Southwest Forestry University and supported by the [Gibbon Conservation Alliance](http://www.gibbonconservation.org/index_engl.html). To assess the anthropogenic threats to hoolock gibbon _Hoolock tianxing_ populations and potential conservation measures, we choose 14 relevant communities in two townships to conduct interview and transect survey. There are 18 groups in Yingjiang County, of which 14 groups are distributed in the collective forests outside the existing nature reserve, which are under local community management. Few direct threats to gibbon were found. The main threats are fructus tsaokos expansion leading to forest fragmentation, and the multiple groups may already been genetically isolated. To address this issue we recommend a series of conservation actions that should be implemented in the near future. We suggest to cooperate with the local forestry bureaus to investigate the land/forest tenures of all the gibbon habitat areas as this has great impacts on the conservation project designing and development in Yingjiang County. Meanwhile, scientific research should be conducted on some groups for providing an underlying foundation for hoolock gibbon conservation. Through some type of community-based conservation education program, we recommend habitat-friendly fructus tsaoko cultivation, for instance, leaving or planting more large trees and food sources trees in the fructus tsaoko fields. For the long-term conservation of gibbons, we consider that the initial habitat restoration efforts should be conducted to connect the subpopulations in Lamahe and Xiangbai."
abstract_short = "Interestingly, to some extent, the current legacy hoolock gibbon population in China is due to the tradition of not hunting gibbons."
