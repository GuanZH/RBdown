      <description>In 2015, we conducted the hoolock gibbon hoolock tianxing survey in Yingjiang County. The survey reported the hoolock gibbon population status and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the species in Yingjiang County, West Yunnan, China. The survey was undertaken from January to December 2015, Dr. Guan Zhenhua and Associate Professor Li Maobiao from Yunnan Academy of Biodiversity, Southwest Forestry University and supported by the Gibbon Conservation Alliance.
