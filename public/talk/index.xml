      <description>This is Yunnan popular science speech contest, I was giving a talk about apes in China. Time is limited in 5 minutes. Unluckily, I did not get very good scores for promotion. First time is good enough, I have another experience facing the public and promote our gibbon conservation.</description>

      <description>This is opening ceremony with the first speech. I gave the speech on the topic &amp;ldquo;The apes and monkeys in Yunnan&amp;rdquo;. In this speech, I talk about primates on the earth. Specifically, I talk leave monkeys and gibbons in Yunnan. All the junior school students showed their passion and curiosity on my topic. Start with the figure &amp;ldquo;King of monkey&amp;rdquo;, end with how we conduct research on them, and why they need conservation.</description>
