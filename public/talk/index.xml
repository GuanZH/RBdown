      <description>This is opening ceremony with the first speech. I gave the speech on the topic &amp;ldquo;The apes and monkeys in Yunnan&amp;rdquo;. In this speech, I talk about primates on the earth. Specifically, I talk leave monkeys and gibbons in Yunnan. All the junior school students showed their passion and curiosity on my topic. Start with the figure &amp;ldquo;King of monkey&amp;rdquo;, end with how we conduct research on them, and why they need conservation.</description>
