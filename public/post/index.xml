 The question is how to merge two tables, it is easy to use merge. However, it is not easy to merge because the two table have different sample sizes and we want to keep all of them.
 Table 1: Some names not in table 2  name plot1    name_j 1  name_w 2  name_z 3  name_f 4  name_a 5  name_e 6  name_u 7  name_y 8  name_t 9  name_m 10  name_r 11  name_o 12  name_l 13  name_x 14  name_q 15     Table 1: Some names not in table 1  name plot2    name_o 1  name_w 2  name_b 3  name_a 4  name_c 5  name_y 6  name_i 7  name_e 8  name_g 9  name_d 10    Now we have problems, some names exist in table 1 but not in table 2, and vice verse.</description>
