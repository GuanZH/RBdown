      <description>summary = “Create a beautifully simple website or blog in under 10 minutes.”
The question is how to merge two tables, it is easy to use merge. However, it is not easy to merge because the two table have different sample sizes and we want to keep all of them.
 Table 1: Some names not in table 2  name plot1    name_k 1  name_s 2  name_f 3  name_b 4  name_l 5  name_a 6  name_w 7  name_t 8  name_q 9  name_v 10  name_o 11  name_d 12  name_y 13  name_g 14  name_h 15     Table 1: Some names not in table 1  name plot2    name_o 1  name_p 2  name_y 3  name_j 4  name_f 5  name_i 6  name_l 7  name_v 8  name_b 9  name_d 10    Now we have problems, some names exist in table 1 but not in table 2, and vice verse.</description>
